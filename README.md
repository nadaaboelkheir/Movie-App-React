# Movie & TV Show App with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built using modern web development tools including React Router, Bootstrap, Material-UI, lazy loading, React hooks, and Axios for fetching data. Environment variables are handled using a `.env` file.

## Key Features
- **Show Movies, TV Shows & Actors**: Browse a list of movies, TV shows, and series, and view detailed information about each one and its cast.
- **Details for Movies**: See specific details for each movie or show, including cast, synopsis, and release information.
- **Favorite Movies**: Add movies and TV shows to a favorite list and view them on a dedicated favorites page.
- **Search Movies**: Search for both movies and TV shows using a search bar and filter the results accordingly.
- **404 Page**: Gracefully handle invalid routes with a custom 404 error page.
